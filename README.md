High level definitions to work with GNSS in Rust

+ Space Vehicles definitions: `SV`
+ GNSS Constellations: `Constellation`
+ GNSS Timescales: `Constellation.timescale()`

## Getting started

Add "gnss" to your Cargo.toml

```toml
gnss-rs = "2"
```

Import "gnss-rs": 

```rust
extern crate gnss_rs as gnss;
```

## Space Vehicles

```rust
extern crate gnss_rs as gnss;

use gnss::sv;
use gnss::prelude::*;
use std::str::FromStr;
use hifitime::TimeScale;

let sv = SV::new(Constellation::GPS, 1);
assert_eq!(sv.constellation, Constellation::GPS);
assert_eq!(sv.prn, 1);
assert_eq!(sv.timescale(), Some(TimeScale::GPST));
assert_eq!(sv, sv!("G01"));
assert_eq!(sv.launched_date(), None);
```

## SBAS support

We support SBAS (geostationary augmentations) systems. 

```rust
extern crate gnss_rs as gnss;

use gnss::sv;
use gnss::prelude::*;
use std::str::FromStr;
use hifitime::{Epoch, TimeScale};

let sv = sv!("S23");
assert_eq!(sv.constellation, Constellation::EGNOS);
let launched_date = Epoch::from_str("2021-11-01T00:00:00 UTC")
    .unwrap();
assert_eq!(sv.launched_date(), Some(launched_date));
```

## Other definitions and features

Other definitions and features exist. Use compilation options (crate features) to unlock them.
The idea is to maintain a very minimal default library.

- The SERDE features unlocks serialization/deserialization of the main structures defined here.

- The DOMES features unlocks the definition of DOMES GNSS/IGS reference station,
that are widely used in GNSS data processing. This number identifies a station uniquely.

- The COSPAR features unlocks the definition of the COSPAR (Launch) ID number.
This number identifies the launch of a vehicule uniquely. It is used in RINEX
and other files format.

- The SBAS feature will create a static database that defines each SBAS service areas,
projected on ground as WKT/GEO objects, with one method to select a SBAS service based
on Latitude and Longitude coordinates.
